#### 1. Rounding and Borderline Cases

- **Q: What happens if my RegTotal is exactly 69.5%?**  
    **A:** Although this situation is very rare, if your RegTotal is exactly 69.5%, you should either contact the dean’s office or consult your teacher for clarification.

- **Q: What if one subject’s RegTotal is slightly below 70% (e.g., 69%)?**  
    **A:** In such cases, you always have the possibility to negotiate with your teacher. However, an adjustment is not guaranteed—it depends on the teacher’s policy.    
#### 2. Calculation Adjustments and Additional Variables

- **Q: How do I include additional variables or bonus points in the calculation?**  
    **A:** By default, the system uses the variables specified in the syllabus. However, if a teacher adds extra points for additional work, you can include those as additional variables within the system.

#### 3. FX Final Exam Details

- **Q: How many FX Final attempts are allowed during the examination period?**  
    **A:** Only one FX Final attempt is permitted, as the entire examination period lasts a maximum of three weeks.
    
- **Q: What if my FX Final score is lower than my original Final exam score?**  
    **A:** Typically, the highest score will be used. However, remember that you can only take the FX Final if your original Final exam score is below 50%.
    
- **Q: Are there any scheduling details for the FX Final exam?**  
    **A:** Yes, the exam schedule outlines the available time slots for both the Final exam and FX Final. Please refer to the final exam schedule for specific dates and times.
    

#### 4. Summer Term Requirements and Financial Implications

- **Q: What happens if my RegMid or RegEnd falls below 25% before the exam period?**  
    **A:** If either RegMid or RegEnd is below 25%, you might be assigned to the summer term. In some cases, you may try to negotiate with your teacher to gain access to the Final exam, but the likelihood of entering the summer term increases.
    
- **Q: How is the cost for the summer term determined?**  
    **A:** The cost depends on the number of credits for the subject and your level of study (Bachelor, Master, Doctoral, or Foreign National). For example, if one item is worth 5 credits, a bachelor student may need to pay a fee calculated at the rate applicable for that credit load. Refer to your institution’s fee schedule for exact amounts.
    
- **Q: What if I exceed the 27-credit limit in an academic year?**  
    **A:** If you earn more than 27 credits in one academic year, you won’t be allowed to take the summer term for subjects exceeding that credit limit. Failure to complete the required subjects may result in additional fees or the loss of scholarship eligibility.
    

#### 5. Attendance Issues

- **Q: How is attendance recorded, and what if there’s a discrepancy?**  
    **A:** Attendance is tracked for both physical and remote classes. It is generally determined by the teacher based on the criteria set in the syllabus. If you notice an error (for example, if you’re marked late or absent due to technical issues), discuss the discrepancy with your teacher and, if necessary, escalate it to the dean’s office or technical department.
    
- **Q: What constitutes acceptable attendance?**  
    **A:** The usual minimum threshold is 70%. However, this may vary by course. In case of ambiguity, please re-confirm with your teacher.
    

#### 6. Syllabus and Grade Discrepancies

- **Q: Where can I find the syllabus for my courses?**  
    **A:** The syllabus is typically available on the LMS (e.g., Moodle) in PDF format. It is usually published by the end of the first week of the academic period.
    
- **Q: What should I do if the syllabus information conflicts with the grade calculations in the LMS?**  
    **A:** If there’s any discrepancy between the syllabus and the LMS calculations, rely on the syllabus and consult your teacher to resolve the issue.
    

#### 7. General System and Notifications

- **Q: How do I monitor my grades and receive updates about deadlines?**  
    **A:** While the LMS provides grade and attendance information, it does not typically send notifications. Previously, a Telegram bot (ReMoodle) was used for this purpose, but it is no longer maintained. Stay proactive by regularly checking the LMS and communicating with your teacher.
    
- **Q: Can I plan my grades in advance?**  
    **A:** Yes, the system can convert your desired RegTotal goal into the minimum required scores for each component. For example, to target a scholarship (RegTotal ≥70%), planning scenarios such as RegMid=25, RegEnd=75, RegFinal=100; RegMid=50, RegEnd=50, RegFinal=100; or RegMid=70, RegEnd=70, RegFinal=70 can help. It is also recommended to maintain attendance above 90% for optimal results.
    

#### 8. Additional Considerations

- **Q: What if my teacher calculates grades differently than the standard system described here?**  
    **A:** If your teacher uses a different method than the Standard Grading System (SGS), you should discuss the differences directly with your teacher or, if necessary, with your department.
    
- **Q: How do I ensure that I meet the minimum requirements to avoid FX exams or summer term assignment?**  
    **A:** Make sure that your RegMid and RegEnd are at least 25%, your RegFinal is at least 50%, and your attendance is at least 70%. Adhering to these minimum requirements will help you avoid needing to take FX exams or being assigned to the summer term.
